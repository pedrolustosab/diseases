      "When did CDC abortion surveillance start?\n",
      "CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and jurisdiction conduct abortion surveillance. This information is voluntarily reported to CDC. CDC’s surveillance system compiles the information from states and jurisdictions on legal induced abortions.\n",
      "How does CDC define abortion?\n",
      "For the purpose of surveillance, a legal induced abortion is defined as \"an intervention performed by a licensed clinician (for instance, a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) within the limits of state regulations, that is intended to terminate a suspected or known ongoing intrauterine pregnancy and that does not result in a live birth.\" This definition excludes management of intrauterine fetal death, early pregnancy failure/loss, ectopic pregnancy, or retained products of conception. Most states and jurisdictions that collect abortion data report whether an abortion was performed by medication or surgery.\n",
      "Are states and jurisdictions required to report their abortion data to CDC?\n",
      "No, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report data to CDC for inclusion in its annualAbortion Surveillancereport. CDC's Division of Reproductive Health prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting.\n",
      "States and jurisdictions needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC atContact CDC-INFO.\n",
      "How is the report prepared and formatted?\n",
      "Preparation of theAbortion Surveillancereport is based on the data available from the states and jurisdictions that voluntarily provide this information for a given calendar year. After CDC receives the data, staff perform the analyses that produce the tables, the figure, and the narrative describing methods and trends. For more information on compilation of the report, please view the abstract and methods portion of the most recentAbortion Surveillancereport.\n",
      "How is the Abortion Surveillance Report used?\n",
      "This report is used for many purposes in the field of public health, including to:\n",
      "Evaluate the success of programs aimed at promoting equitable access to patient-centered quality contraceptive services in the United States, to reduce unintended pregnancies.Calculate pregnancy rates, on the basis of the number of pregnancies ending in abortion, in conjunction with birth data and estimates of pregnancy loss.Monitor changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion, such as changes in the types of procedures used and the weeks of gestation at the time of abortion.Calculate the national legal induced abortion case-fatality rate.\n",

      "There are four common types of abuse and neglect:\n",
      "Physical abuseis the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child.1Sexual abuseinvolves pressuring or forcing a child to engage in sexual acts. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities.1Read more information aboutchild sexual abuse.Emotional abuserefers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love.1Neglectis the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs.

      "Quick facts and stats\n",
      "Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States.3This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States.4\n",
      "Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status.1\n",
      "Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018.5This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.6\n",
      "Outcomes\n",
      "Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress.1\n",
      "Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities.1\n",
      "Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties.7\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "Child abuse and neglect can be prevented.Certain factors may increase or decrease the riskof perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect.\n",

The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn’t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence.\n",
      "Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.2From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred.3\n",
      "Compared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides.34The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002–2016) and more than 35% among women (2007–2016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016.3Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002–2016).3\n",
      "Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness).4\n",
      "Outcomes\n",
      "Abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others.5\n",
      "Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse.45678\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "Violence against older adults can be prevented.Certain factors may increase or decrease the riskof perpetrating or experiencing abuse. Preventing violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them violence.\n",
      "We can all help prevent violence against older adults:9\n",
      "Listen to older adults to understand their challenges and provide support.Educate yourself and others about how to recognize and report abuse.Learn how the signs of abuse differ from the normal aging process.Check-in on older adults who may have few friends and family members.Encourage or assist persons (caregivers or older adults) who have problems with drugs or alcohol in getting help.\n",

However, most prevention strategies and practices have not yet been rigorously evaluated to determine their effectiveness. In the absence of proven prevention strategies, program planners may consider the following sources to strengthen their approach:Applying the Principles of Prevention: What do Prevention Practitioners Need to Know About What WorksandWhat Works in Prevention: Principles of Effective Prevention Programs.\n",
